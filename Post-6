<p>On the outside, it looks as though it’s the perfect place to live. It’s easy to admire the perfect balance between the future – Japan boasts some of the world’s most technologically advanced systems; the present – the social, arts, food and drinks, and entertainment culture is rivalled by none; and past – they’re a proud country with strong roots to their traditions and their history is still evident almost everywhere you look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fun Fact: Did you know that the population of Japan also boasts some of the world’s oldest living people on the Okinawan Islands?</p>

<p>In the past, and still quite evident in companies today, those working for corporations follow an extremely strict hierarchy. There is a distinct relationship between the ‘senpai’ (experienced), and the ‘kohai’ (inexperienced).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most people who work in the major cities like Tokyo and Osaka typically take on office jobs and are collectively known as Japanese salarymen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when you take on these jobs, there are a few assumptions that need to be made, such as: overtime is expected; you should probably not leave work before your manager does; and if your manager wants to go for a drink after work, you’ll be accompanying them.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s become somewhat of a social phenomenon for salarymen to drink themselves silly with their colleagues on a Friday night, pass out on the streets, and wake up to catch the earliest train home. You will see for yourself if you’re out and about in the city at the end of the working week!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These days, there are small but growing shifts in the workplace. The traditional route of spending your entire life at one company is slowly disappearing, with more and more younger people likely to become ‘furita’ and holding multiple part-time/casual jobs (for more freedom), moving overseas to work, or simply staying at home.<ins></ins></p>

<p>This is probably our favourite part of lifestyle in Japan! Where do we even begin with the Japanese food culture?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When traveling to Japan, food is often the main focus of many itineraries. It’s so vastly different from many other countries, there are so many layers of complexities with the food culture – what to eat, how to eat it, where to eat it, etc.<ins></ins></p>

<p>First thing’s first: what people need to know is, there is so much more to Japan than sushi! Check here 10 popular Japanese dishes.</p>

<p>One of the very first thoughts people have when thinking about Japan is how much fresh sushi they’re going to consume (we’re also putting our hands up here – guilty as charged!), and we totally get it. Sushi is delicious and easy, but did you know that some sushi establishments in Japan also consider its creation an artform?</p>

<p>There’s quite a variety of Japanese sushi rolls out there, outside of the usual maki rolls that people order. If you’re interested in finding out more, we’ve detailed an entire list of 12 traditional Japanese sushi rolls you <em>need </em>to taste here!</p>

<p>Aside from sushi, it’s good to understand that rice is a staple in the Japanese people’s diet, and quite a few Japanese foods incorporate it. This includes donburi (which simmered or fried food is served over rice), onigiri (small parcels of rice with filling inside, wrapped in seaweed), mochi (pounded rice cakes), and the lesser-known chazuke (rice served with green tea poured in).</p>

<p>If you’re a big fan of seafood, you’re in luck! Given Japan’s geographic location, fresh seafood is an essential to the regular Japanese diet. Whether it’s eaten live (odorigui-style, literally fresh from the ocean and sometimes still moving!), raw (sashimi), grilled (yaki), or deep-fried (tempura) – the freshness of the ocean is not too far away.&nbsp;</p>
