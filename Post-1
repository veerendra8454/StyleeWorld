<p>The work <strong>culture in India</strong> is quite different from that of the western countries. It is a reflection of the values and beliefs practiced by Indian people. The office environment is quite informal because employees are treated as equals and everyone’s views are entertained. In India, work is given the top priority, which often leads to an imbalance in work-life. Work timings are generally <strong>9 am to 5 pm.</strong> Companies follow the hierarchical system and decision making is usually from top to the bottom. People in India don’t adhere to time strictly even though they work overtime and sometimes on the weekend as well. Titles such as Mr. and Ms. are used to address each other in Indian work culture.</p>

<p>Although India is known as the<strong>&nbsp;largest democracy, complete quality&nbsp;</strong>is still not evident in day-to-day life. Societal hierarchy is evident in caste groups, amongst individuals, and in family and kinship groups. Hierarchy [plays a pivotal role in the lives of the Indians where men outrank women of similar age and juniors are outranked by their seniors. The idea of social interdependence is immaculate among Indian people. People are deeply involved with others, and for many, the greatest fear is being left alone without the support of others.</p>
