<h3>Learning atmosphere</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Australians are known for being friendly and good-natured, so you’re bound to experience their world-famous hospitality while you’re studying here. The learning atmosphere in educational institutions across Australia is generally very supportive as you’ll be surrounded by like-minded students and tutors who want to help you during your studies. You’re encouraged to interact in class and ask for assistance when you need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Assignments are often done in teams, which builds collaboration and communication skills. When you’re working on something solo, you’ll be expected to take initiative and come up with your own ideas – most Australian educational institutions promote independent thinking.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Food</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to Australia’s multicultural population and varied natural environment, the local food scene is incredibly diverse. The fertile rural and coastal regions supply healthy produce to supermarkets around the country, meaning Australians have plenty of fruit, vegetables and fresh seafood available all year long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Australians also enjoy a rich variety of food from around the world. You can find almost every international cuisine in restaurants, cafes, takeaway eateries and pubs across the country. Don’t forget to try traditional Aussie foods like Vegemite, kangaroo, ANZAC biscuits, Tim Tams and lamingtons during your stay, too.</p>

<p>In Australia, everyone looks forward to the weekend. It’s an excuse to head outside and relax with friends and family. As most of Australia’s major cities are dotted along the coastline, many people head to the beach for a swim or the park for a barbeque lunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cafe culture is big in Australia too, so you’ll often find a lot of people enjoying brunch (a mixture of breakfast and lunch) on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Australians also often watch or play sports to unwind and socialise. Cricket and Australian Rules Football (AFL) are popular, as are rugby league (NRL), tennis, swimming, surfing, field hockey, basketball, soccer, netball and cycling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Australia is full of wild landscapes, lots of people like to keep active by going hiking and exploring the national parks and nature reserves outside the city.</p>

<h3>Work/Life balance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you eventually end up in an Australian workplace, it pays to know how to navigate the local customs. The work/life balance in Australia is said to be pretty relaxed compared to other countries. Australians tend to value their leisure time and often arrive at the office at 9am and head home at 5pm (or shortly thereafter).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bars and pubs are popular places to chill out in after a hard day’s work, and most Aussies love nothing better than hanging out with friends over a few drinks. If drinking’s not your thing, there are plenty of opportunities to meet up for dinner or see a live music show.</p>
